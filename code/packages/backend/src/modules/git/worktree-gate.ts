// The WORKING-TREE GATE — "nobody writes into a git working copy while git is mid-cycle in it".
//
// The per-storage lock in git-lock.ts serializes the git CYCLES against each other, but it never covered the
// OTHER writer: `mirrorToSyncRepo()` (tracking-sync.service.ts) copies a repo's Category-B tracking subtree
// into `<syncRepo>/repos/<repoUid>/` from the SCAN path, synchronously, with no lock at all. When that copy
// landed while a cycle was between its fetch and its merge, git refused the whole merge —
//
//     error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
//     	repos/83e62afc2c80/repo_storage.yaml
//     Aborting
//
// — and the storage stopped converging between the user's computers, which is the entire product promise.
//
// The gate is deliberately NOT a lock: the mirror is synchronous top to bottom (`writeRepoStorage` →
// `mirrorToSyncRepo`) and cannot await anything. Instead a writer asks "is this path inside a working tree
// that is mid-cycle right now?" and, if so, DEFERS its own work by key; the cycle runs every deferred job
// when it releases. Deferring by key coalesces — ten scans of one repo during one cycle mirror ONCE at the
// end, which is exactly as correct (the mirror is a reconciliation to current state, not a work item).
